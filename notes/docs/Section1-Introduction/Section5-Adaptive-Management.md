# Section 5: Adaptive Management 
## Adaptive Management and Revisions
As part of the adaptive management process, the RAs use information and data acquired from WQIP implementation and water quality monitoring to inform management decisions related to water quality conditions, numeric goals, strategies, and associated schedules. As necessary, RAs may revise the WQIP, respective JRMPs, and/or BMP Design Manuals based upon new data, information, and/or feedback received during the implementation of the WQIP.

Updates and minor modifications to the WQIP, JRMPs, and BMP Design Manuals are presented in this section.
## 5.1 Updates
The adaptive management process may prompt updates to the WQIP and respective JRMPs. Updates to the WQIP require the collaboration of the RAs and follow, as applicable, a public participation process similar to that implemented during WQIP development. The public participation process includes a solicitation for data and information and consultation with the WQIP Consultation Panel. Updates can be provided in the WQIP annual reports or the Report of Waste Discharge (ROWD). WQIP updates may include significant changes to the highest priority water quality conditions, numeric goals, or monitoring and assessment. BMP Design Manual updates or JRMP updates, such as program modifications and/or amendments to the JRMPs, are performed as needed by RAs.

Updates to the WQIP, respective JRMPs, and BMP Design Manuals during the reporting period are presented in the following sections.

### 5.1.1 WQIP
**RWQCB Accepted WQIP Updates in Reporting Period**

The revised WQIP was submitted in September 2021, accepted by the RWQCB in December 2021, and is available on the [Regional Clearinghouse](www.projectcleanwater.org).

The update focuses on the Agua Hedionda HA, specifically to analyze bacteria data concerning the impacts of the beneficial uses (Shellfish Harvesting and Contact Recreation Use) in the Agua Hedionda Lagoon and tributaries. Primary revisions in the 2021 WQIP include:

### 5.1.2 JRMPs and BMP Design Manuals
In FY22, the City of Carlsbad and City of Vista updated their respective BMP Design Manuals. The City of Escondido revised its JRMP and updated the Storm Water Design Manual. These updates are summarized below.

**City of Carlsbad**

In FY 2022, the city updated its BMP Design Manual to require that all development projects within a priority land use (PLU) area are subject to the Trash Amendments (or Trash Capture requirements) and must implement BMPs that prevent the discharge of trash from their property. PLUs include land areas designated as high-density residential, industrial, commercial, mixed urban and public transportation stations. All areas within the project’s property boundary are subject to trash capture, including DMAs excluded from DCV (design capture volume) calculations. The project boundary is defined as the drainage tributary area(s) that contains the proposed improvements. If the city’s right-of-way adjacent to a self-mitigating area contains sufficient BMPs for trash capture per the city’s Trash Capture Program, the self-mitigating area may be excluded from trash capture requirements subject to discretion of the City Engineer.

Exemptions to Trash Capture are as follows:
- a
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 

All Priority Development Projects (PDPs), as defined by the Permit, are required to implement Trash Capture BMPs.

The City of Carlsbad’s updated BMP Design Manual is available on the City’s [website](https://www.carlsbadca.gov/departments/community-development/land-development-engineering)

**City of Vista**

In September 2021, the City of Vista made targeted updates to its BMP Design Manual to address the following:
- Text related to projects that disturb greater than one acre of area
- Clarified that projects disturbing one acre of land are presumed to generate post-construction pollutants
- Removed reference to pools and ponds being excluded from impervious area calculations

Following completion of these targeted updates, additional revisions to the city’s BMP Design Manual were initiated. Revisions will continue through FY23. The revised September 2021 manual can be found on the city’s website: https://www.cityofvista.com/departments/community-development/permits-forms/land-development-autocad-templates/storm-water-forms

The city’s Jurisdictional Runoff Management Program (JRMP) document was previously revised in FY19. The 2019 JRMP document is available on the “Watersheds” tab on the city’s stormwater website (www.cityofvista.com/stormwater) and the regional clearinghouse website (https://projectcleanwater.org/watersheds/).

The JRMP document is in process of being updated to reflect the following program improvements:
- Review and update of the municipal facility existing development inventory
- Transition from a business-based approach industrial commercial existing development inspections to an onsite property-based inspection approach. The property-based approach facilitates assessment of the exterior of a property, where potential pollutant exposure to rainwater is most likely to occur

These program improvements are currently being incorporated into the city’s JRMP document, and when completed, will be published on the websites.

**City of Escondido**

The City of Escondido developed and adopted a JRMP Updates tracking table to be updated, certified, and submitted with each Annual Report as an amendment to the JRMP. In January 2021, Escondido submitted the first JRMP update table and posted the updated JRMP on the city’s website. An updated version of the table is submitted as part of this annual report, along with the city’s JRMP Annual Report Supplement (see Appendix C).

The City of Escondido proposed an update to the Escondido Storm Water Design Manual based on the 2018 update (and subsequent revisions) to the Regional Model BMP Design Manual and submitted it as part of the FY21 Annual Report. The city received approval from the San Diego Water Board on June 6, 2022. The new version has been posted on the City of Escondido’s website: https://www.escondido.org/bmps-for-new-development-redevelopment.aspx

## 5.2 Minor Modifications
Corrections, additions, or administrative changes to the WQIP or respective JRMPs may be needed for document accuracy or to update implementation efforts. Minor modifications may include changes to activity frequencies, facility inspection inventories, or focus areas identified in the WQIP. These modifications may arise based on the implementation feedback process and may require quick management decisions to support the identified goals and schedules.

Minor modifications identified for the WQIP, JRMPs, and BMP Design Manuals during the FY22 reporting period are presented below.

### 5.2.1 WQIP
Minor modifications to the 2021 WQIP post-September 2021 are as follows:
- a

**Upper San Marcos HA Dry Weather Goals Modifications**

The RAs received a comment letter from RWQCB in May 2021 that included comments regarding the Upper San Marcos HA goals. As part of the FY21 WQIP Annual Report (Appendix B), the RAs submitted response to comments which included analysis of data and the methodology that contributed to a re-evaluation of goals and compliance methods. During the 2021-2022 monitoring year, the County of San Diego and City of San Marcos re-evaluated the dry weather goals and pathways to factor in data and information acquired since the development of the WQIP goals. Using this information, the RAs met with RWQCB staff to coordinate and establish revised dry weather goals and compliance pathways. The WQIP dry weather goals have been updated to reflect the results of the re-evaluation and are provided below (Table 21).

**Table 21: Dry Weather Interim and Final Goals for County of San Diego and City of San Marcos in the Upper San Marcos HA**

### 5.2.2 JRMPs and BMP Design Manuals
**City of Carlsbad**

The City of Carlsbad made minor updates to the city’s JRMP document, including updating the MS4 and Existing Development Maps, Appendices A and B of the JRMP. The city’s JRMP is posted on the city’s website and linked through the Regional Clearinghouse.

**County of San Diego**

The County of San Diego BMP Design Manual (BMP DM) provides guidance for land development and public improvement projects to comply with the 2013 Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Permit (Order No. R9-2013-0001 as amended by R9-2015-0001 and R9-2015-0100). The County BMP DM remains in compliance with Provisions E.3.a-d, as it has since its February 2016 adoption. Staff had previously coordinated an update to the Model BMP DM with the regional Land Development Workgroup in FY 2018. During FY 2021-2022, the County of San Diego BMP Design Manual was updated to provide clarification on process and requirements. Minor updates were made to Appendix A of the BMP Design Manual. Priority Development Project (PDP) Attachment 10: BMP Installation Verification form and PDP Attachment 11: BMP Maintenance Agreement Plans.

The current BMP DM is available online on the County of San Diego’s website: https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/dpw/watersheds/DevelopmentandConstruction/BMP_Design_Manual.html
