# Section 6: Conclusion
## Conclusions
RAs successfully implemented the WQIP during the reporting period through collaborative and proactive efforts on the regional, watershed, and jurisdictional levels. Successful programmatic and water quality outcomes achieved in FY22 helped to protect, preserve, enhance, and restore water quality and designated beneficial uses of waterways within the WMA. Through these efforts:
- Loma Alta HA final numeric goals were achieved,
- Upper San Marcos HA the final wet weather numeric goal was achieved,
- Lower San Marcos HA final dry and wet weather numeric goals were achieved,
- Progress was made towards 2023 interim numeric goals in Agua Hedionda HA, and
- Escondido Creek HA 2023 and 2028 interim numeric goals were achieved.

The RAs will continue to implement strategies and make program adjustments to maintain progress in achieving future interim and final goals.

Dry and wet weather MS4 outfall monitoring for the 2021-2022 monitoring year provided data and information regarding MS4 water quality conditions (see Attachment 4). During the reporting period, 783 dry weather MS4 visual observations were performed, and a total of 35% of major MS4 outfalls were classified as dry (i.e., dry for three consecutive site visits). During dry weather sampling, all results for the dissolved fractions of hexavalent chromium, cadmium, trivalent chromium, iron, lead, and zinc were below the NAL in 100% of the analytical samples. Overall, 78% of the highest priority persistently flowing outfalls samples were below the NALs. During wet weather outfall sampling, 88% of the results met applicable action levels. Parameters below SALs include total cadmium, total copper, total lead, total phosphorus, total zinc, and turbidity.

During FY22, RAs collaborated to update the WQIP and address comments from the RWQCB. A revised updated WQIP was submitted in September 2021 and accepted by the RWQCB in December 2021. The RAs are committed to continuing JRMP and WQIP implementation in FY23 and working collaboratively to improve water quality throughout the Carlsbad WMA.
