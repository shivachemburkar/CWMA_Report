Let's discover **HPWQC Testing, Monitoring, Results**. *INSERT FIGURE HERE*

## Water Quality Conditions

In the WQIP, RAs identified Priority Water Quality Conditions (PWQCs) by evaluating receiving water conditions, MS4 discharges and their potential impacts, and potential sources of pollutants^1^ in the WMA. The WQIP also details the process the RAs used to identify the Highest Priority Water Quality Conditions (HPWQCs). Table 2 and Table 3 list the HA-specific PWQCs and HPWQCs, respectively, per the 2021 WQIP.
