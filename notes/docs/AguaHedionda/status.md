![HA](/img/Goals-Progress/Agua-Hedionda/HA.png)
The Agua Hedionda Hydrologic Area primarily struggles with riparian habitat degradation and hydromodification as its HPWQC. Projects like the Agua Hedionda Creek Restoration Project, Roman Creek Wetland Restoration Project, and Habitat Rehabilitation in Areas of Existing Development were the main efforts taken in FY23 to reduce habitat degradation and hydromodification.
