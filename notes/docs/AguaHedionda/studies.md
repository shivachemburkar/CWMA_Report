**Agua Hedionda Creek Restoration Project**

![Goals](/img/Goals-Progress/Agua-Hedionda/AHCreek.png)

The Agua Hedionda Creek Restoration Project is delayed, and the final construction timeline is
unknown, the city has been actively implementing programmatic strategies within the Agua Hedionda HA 
that have similar water quality benefits as creek restoration. Attachment 2 of the FY22 CWMA WQIP 
Annual Report summarizes the cityâ€™s overall efforts.

**Roman Creek Wetland Restoration Project**

Roman Creek is tributary to Agua Hedionda Creek and flows through Buena Vista Park (Figure 13). The 
Roman Creek Wetland Restoration Project is identified in the Carlsbad WMA WQIP as a strategy for
wetland creation and enhancement to address hydromodification impacts and as a mitigation strategy to
compensate for aquatic resource impactsfrom other city projects. Previous Carlsbad WMA annual reports
detail field studies, design efforts, and environmental permitting activities associated with the Roman 
Creek project. To date, the city has expended $1,136,000 on the project.

In October 2022, one bid of $6,000,000 was submitted, which, while deemed acceptable, surpassed the allocated budget by over $2,300,000.
Consequently, the city paused the project to consider value engineering options and evaluate funding during its Spring 2022 Capital Improvement Budget process.

**Program for Stream, Channel, and/or Existing Habitat Rehabilitation in Areas of Existing Development**

Each RA developed rehabilitation programs as part of their jurisdictional programs to identify areas of
streams, channels, and/or habitats that are candidates for rehabilitation and look for opportunities to
implement projects. While all RAs implemented this program during FY23, the City of Carlsbad
implemented a vegetation maintenance project in the Agua Hedionda HA to mitigate flooding impacts
and protect riparian habitat.

**Agua Hedionda Creek Vegetation Maintenance Project**

Within the City of Carlsbad, long-term maintenance of Agua Hedionda Creek between the Cannon Road
and El Camino Real bridges is necessary to reduce flooding upstream. To improve the creek's flood
capacity, limited vegetation is permitted within this portion of the creek
