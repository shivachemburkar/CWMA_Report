The $120 million restoration project broke ground in November 2017 and is part of the Build North Coast Corridor program of the San Diego Association of Governments and Caltrans. The San Elijo Lagoon Restoration Project (SELRP) includes
- Vegetation clearing and building a series of
dikes along the main lagoon channel and inlet
to control water elevations and turbidity,
- Dredging various channels within the lagoon
to increase tidal flow,
- Restoring mudflats, 
- Establishment of new wetland habitat, and,
- Creation of new pedestrian trails.
