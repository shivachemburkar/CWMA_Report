# Goals Progress
Currently, no HPWQCs are identified in the Buena Vista Creek and Encinitas HAs (Figure 26 and Figure 27,
respectively). Without HPWQCs, no interim and final goals for the HAs are established. However, the
Buena Vista Creek and Encinitas HA RAs implemented strategies in the HAs to protect or improve water
quality. [Appendix D](www.carlsbadwatershed.org) lists and summarizes efforts in the Encinitas and Buena Vista Creek HAs.
