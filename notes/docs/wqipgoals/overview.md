# Water Quality Improvement Progress

This is a streamlined version of the Carlsbad Watershed Management Area water quality improvement goals. The goal of this section is to present you with data graphics on how water quality is improving within the seven hydrologic areas. 

The purpose is to make communicating the water quality improvements digestible and give you a quick idea of how the data was collected.
