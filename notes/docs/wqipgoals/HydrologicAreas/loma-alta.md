During FY23, the city worked with its restoration partners, the Nature Collective and Friends of El Corazon, 
to conduct multiple invasive species treatments, installation of restoration irrigation, native plants, and 
broadcast seeding. The project is currently in Year 5 of the monitoring period and near achieving the 
success criteria for native habitat establishment and invasives control. As of the last vegetation monitoring 
event in July/August 2023, the restoration areas have increased to over 80% native species cover, well 
above the SEP restoration success criteria target of 65% native cover.
