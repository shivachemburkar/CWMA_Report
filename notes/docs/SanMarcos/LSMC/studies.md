# Enhancement Studies


**Evaluate Sanitary Sewer Maintenance and Overflow Prevention** 

Evaluation of sanitary sewer maintenance and overflow protection targets anthropogenic sources of FIB
and contribute to decreased FIB levels in the Lower San Marcos HA.

**Ultraviolet Bacteria Treatment Facility** 

The City of Encinitas operates a UV treatment facility just upstream of Moonlight Beach, eliminating 99% of the FIB passing through the system. The city has an administrative agreement with the San Elijo Joint Powers Authority (SEJPA).
