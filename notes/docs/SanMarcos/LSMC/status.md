# Lower San Marcos Creek HA
![HA](/img/Goals-Progress/Lower-San-Marcos/HA.png)
<!-- The Loma Alta Hydrologic Area primarily struggles with eutrophication issues and specifies algae as its HPWQC. Projects like the [Loma Alta Slough Wetland Enhancement Project](/docs/LomaAlta/Results) and [Garrison Creek Native Habitat Restoration Project](/docs/LomaAlta/Results) were the two main efforts taken in FY23 to reduce algal coverage and biomass. -->
