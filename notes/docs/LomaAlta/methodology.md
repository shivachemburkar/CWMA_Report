**Macroalgal Biomass: Assessment Methodology Download Full Report including [CEDEN](https://www.carlsbadwatershed.org/file-share) Data**

Macroalgal biomass at each point was calculated by dividing the dry weight (g) for each biomass sample by the volume of water sampled (m3). 

The biomass data were averaged for the upstream and downstream locations separately, then together for the entire Slough, which provided an estimate of biomass each month. The results from each month (upstream, downstream and Slough average) were averaged across sampling periods to obtain a percent biomass value (g dw/m3) for the year’s monitoring period.

**Macroalgal Percent Cover: Assessment Methodology Download Full Report including [CEDEN](https://www.carlsbadwatershed.org/file-share) Data**

Macroalgal percent cover was estimated based on the number of point-intercepts for which algae was observed, divided by the total number of point intercepts in each transect as described in Section 2.1.2.2. As with the biomass, the upstream and downstream transects were averaged separately, then together for the entire Slough, which provided an estimate of percent cover each month. 

The results from each month (upstream, downstream, and Slough average) were averaged across sampling periods to obtain a percent cover estimate for the year’s monitoring period.
