# Loma Alta Hydrologic Area
![HA](/img/Goals-Progress/Loma-Alta/Loma-Alta-HA.png)
The Loma Alta Hydrologic Area primarily struggles with eutrophication issues and specifies algae as its HPWQC. Projects like the [Loma Alta Slough Wetland Enhancement Project](/docs/LomaAlta/Results) and [Garrison Creek Native Habitat Restoration Project](/docs/LomaAlta/Results) were the two main efforts taken in FY23 to reduce algal coverage and biomass.
